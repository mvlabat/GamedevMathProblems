# GamedevMathProblems

This is my own project which I use for studying and gathering gamedev mathematical problems.<BR>
I take all the formulas from the Internet, implement them in my classes (My2D, My3D).<BR>
I also test all the written functionality with Google Test framework: https://github.com/google/googletest

## Building
```
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running tests
```
cd build/My2D/tests
./allTests
```
